> **TL;DR** - Python can drive GPUDirect RDMA at line rate without a large
> transfer-engine abstraction. `rdma4py` provides lightweight, backend-specific
> bindings for ibverbs, AWS EFA, and NVMe-oF, reaching about 400 gbps in our
> benchmarks while preserving direct access to the underlying APIs.

## Introduction

Recently, quite a few different "transfer engines" have been developed for fast
weight synchronization between machines using RDMA-capable transports and
libraries such as NVLink, ibverbs, EFA, NVMe-oF, and SPDK. These include projects
such as [Mooncake](https://github.com/kvcache-ai/Mooncake),
[NIXL](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl), and
[Uniflow](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchcomms/tree/main/comms/uniflow).
As with any large project and abstraction, these projects make trade-offs around
specific use cases that might not be optimal for yours.

CPU-initiated RDMA transfers have started appearing in quite a few places in
large-scale training and inference. They can be especially helpful for complex
operations that do not fit well into existing collectives, such as checkpointing
(GPU to disk and GPU to remote VRAM), reinforcement-learning weight
synchronization (GPU to GPU), and fault tolerance (GPU to GPU).

There are a few key observations:

1. Underlying libraries such as libibverbs have historically required C or C++,
   which creates a significant barrier to entry for ML researchers and projects
   that largely live in Python.
2. Unlike protocols such as TCP, RDMA transfers tend to have very little CPU
   overhead for large payloads. It is therefore straightforward to reach
   line-rate speeds while driving them from Python.
3. Most projects use only one hardware platform and network. Abstractions across
   many platforms can limit performance by giving up control in favor of
   generalization.
4. Coding agents make it much easier to get RDMA working quickly, even with
   advanced features such as multi-QP or multi-lane transfers, which are required
   for maximum performance across machines in real-world clusters.
5. RDMA APIs are much simpler than many people assume.

## rdma4py

This brings us to [rdma4py](https://github.com/d4l3k/rdma4py), a set of
lightweight bindings that exposes raw control over the underlying libraries
rather than trying to be an abstraction. `rdma4py` does not aim to be a
full-fledged transfer engine, though one could be built on top of it as needed.
It is currently a prototype and may have breaking API changes.

It provides bindings for the most common patterns we see:

- **ibverbs:** InfiniBand and RoCE
- **EFA:** Elastic Fabric Adapter on AWS
- **NVMe-oF:** NVMe over RDMA fabrics, for remote NVMe drives using `nvmet_rdma`

Because each backend is largely standalone, it is easy to add new hardware
bindings with full control without worrying about compatibility with the other
backends. UCX and libfabric are both good candidates for future bindings.

Each backend is built as a separate package, so downstream users can install
only the bindings they need:

```shell
uv pip install ibverbs efa nvmeof
```

The packages use Cython bindings with `dlopen` and `dlsym`, so the prebuilt
wheels should work across most Python, ibverbs, EFA, and kernel versions without
a custom build. They use Python's stable ABI3 and support Python 3.9 and newer.

## Benchmarks

To validate the design and show that it is more than a Python toy, we benchmarked
`rdma4py` on real hardware. The results demonstrate that Python is not a
bottleneck, even at the 400 Gbps line rate of the NICs.

We used both an ibverbs machine and an AWS EFA machine with four H100 GPUs. Each
benchmark performed a point-to-point transfer between multiple NICs and two
hardware devices:

- **ibverbs:** H100 -> NIC -> remote NIC -> H100
- **EFA:** H100 -> 4 EFA NICs -> 4 remote EFA NICs -> H100
- **NVMe-oF:** H100 -> NIC -> remote NIC -> NVMe, and the reverse read path

Although these benchmarks ran on single machines, that does not invalidate the
result: they demonstrate that Python application code can achieve line-rate
transfers. We used multiple queue pairs or lanes where possible and paired GPUs
and NICs within a NUMA/PCIe node for maximum bandwidth.

![Measured GPUDirect bandwidth by message size](/rdma4py/rdma4py-bandwidth.png)

EFA peaked at **48.88 GB/s**, ibverbs at **48.55 GB/s**, and NVMe-oF at
**27.85 GB/s**. NVMe-oF did not hit the RDMA NICs' line rate, likely because of
NVMe read/write I/O limits rather than overhead in our implementation.

![Measured GPUDirect completion latency by message size](/rdma4py/rdma4py-latency.png)

For small transfers, EFA latency was 20-30 microseconds, ibverbs was about 5
microseconds, and NVMe-oF was 50-100 microseconds. NVMe-oF requires additional
synchronization, which accounts for some of its extra latency.

The full setup and results are available in the backend-specific reports:

- [EFA benchmarks](https://github.com/d4l3k/rdma4py/blob/main/efa/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [ibverbs benchmarks](https://github.com/d4l3k/rdma4py/blob/main/ibverbs/BENCHMARKS.md)
- [NVMe-oF benchmarks](https://github.com/d4l3k/rdma4py/blob/main/nvmeof/BENCHMARKS.md)

## API

The high-level APIs for these backends are relatively simple, resulting in
fairly minimal Python examples. A complete example is about 150 lines without
abstractions. It is not a one-line solution, but it provides raw control and is
tractable to implement without the overhead of a full transfer engine. LLMs make
these algorithms even more accessible.

### ibverbs

The following example performs a one-sided write from rank 0 to rank 1:

```python
import ibverbs as ib
import ibverbs.cuda as ibcuda

...

WRITE_COMPLETE = 0xC0DE


def wait(cq):
    while True:
        completions = cq.poll(1)
        if completions:
            completions[0].raise_for_status()
            return completions[0]


hca = ib.get_device_list()[0]

with hca.open() as ctx, ctx.alloc_pd() as pd:
    port_attr = ctx.query_port(RDMA_PORT)
    gid = ctx.query_gid(RDMA_PORT, GID_INDEX)

    with ctx.create_cq(16) as cq:
        qp_init = ib.QPInitAttr(
            send_cq=cq,
            recv_cq=cq,
            qp_type=ib.QPType.RC,
            max_send_wr=16,
            max_recv_wr=16,
        )

        with pd.create_qp(qp_init) as qp:
            # Exchange the information needed to connect the RC QPs.
            local_qp = ib.local_qp_info(
                qp, port_attr, gid, port=RDMA_PORT
            )
            local_wire = torch.tensor(
                list(local_qp.to_bytes()), dtype=torch.uint8
            )
            qp_wires = [
                torch.empty_like(local_wire)
                for _ in range(world_size)
            ]
            dist.all_gather(qp_wires, local_wire)

            remote_qp = ib.QPInfo.from_bytes(
                bytes(qp_wires[peer].tolist())
            )

            ib.connect_rc(
                qp,
                remote_qp,
                port=RDMA_PORT,
                sgid_index=GID_INDEX,
                access=ib.AccessFlags.REMOTE_WRITE,
            )

            tensor = (
                torch.arange(1024, dtype=torch.int32, device=gpu)
                if rank == 0
                else torch.zeros(1024, dtype=torch.int32, device=gpu)
            )

            mr_access = (
                ib.AccessFlags.LOCAL_WRITE
                | ib.AccessFlags.REMOTE_WRITE
            )
            with ibcuda.register_tensor(pd, tensor, mr_access) as mr:
                target = torch.zeros(2, dtype=torch.int64)

                if rank == 1:
                    target[0] = mr.addr
                    target[1] = mr.rkey

                    # WRITE_WITH_IMM consumes an RQ entry but does not
                    # place its payload in this receive request.
                    qp.post_recv(
                        ib.RecvWR(wr_id=1, sg_list=[])
                    )

                # Publish rank 1's destination address and rkey. Because
                # rank 1 posts its receive first, this also establishes
                # notification readiness.
                dist.broadcast(target, src=1)

                if rank == 0:
                    # Wait only for work previously submitted to the
                    # stream that produced the source tensor.
                    torch.cuda.current_stream(gpu).synchronize()

                    qp.post_send(
                        ib.SendWR(
                            wr_id=2,
                            sg_list=[mr.sge()],
                            opcode=ib.WROpcode.RDMA_WRITE_WITH_IMM,
                            send_flags=ib.SendFlags.SIGNALED,
                            remote_addr=int(target[0]),
                            rkey=int(target[1]),
                            imm_data=WRITE_COMPLETE,
                        )
                    )

                    completion = wait(cq)
                    assert completion.opcode == ib.WCOpcode.RDMA_WRITE

                else:
                    notification = wait(cq)

                    assert (
                        notification.opcode
                        == ib.WCOpcode.RECV_RDMA_WITH_IMM
                    )
                    assert notification.wc_flags & ib.WCFlags.WITH_IMM
                    assert notification.imm_data == WRITE_COMPLETE

                    with torch.cuda.device(gpu):
                        ibcuda.flush_gpudirect_writes()

                    expected = torch.arange(
                        1024,
                        dtype=torch.int32,
                        device=gpu,
                    )
                    assert torch.equal(tensor, expected)
```

#### Multiple queue pairs

For more performance, create multiple queue pairs and shard transfers across
them. In practice, a thin wrapper could hide the multiple QPs behind register,
send, receive, and signaling APIs:

```python
with hca.open() as ctx, ctx.alloc_pd() as pd, ExitStack() as stack:
    port_attr = ctx.query_port(RDMA_PORT)
    gid = ctx.query_gid(RDMA_PORT, GID_INDEX)
    cq = stack.enter_context(ctx.create_cq(NUM_QPS * 4))

    qp_init = ib.QPInitAttr(
        send_cq=cq,
        recv_cq=cq,
        qp_type=ib.QPType.RC,
        max_send_wr=4,
        max_recv_wr=4,
    )
    qps = [
        stack.enter_context(pd.create_qp(qp_init))
        for _ in range(NUM_QPS)
    ]

    ...

    qp_access = ib.AccessFlags.REMOTE_WRITE if rank == 1 else 0
    for index, qp in enumerate(qps):
        ...
        ib.connect_rc(
            qp,
            remote_qp,
            port=RDMA_PORT,
            sgid_index=GID_INDEX,
            access=qp_access,
        )

    ...

    with ibcuda.register_tensor(pd, tensor, mr_access) as mr:
        ...
        for index, qp in enumerate(qps):
            offset = index * chunk_size
            qp.post_send(
                ib.SendWR(
                    wr_id=index,
                    sg_list=[mr.sge(chunk_size, offset=offset)],
                    opcode=ib.WROpcode.RDMA_WRITE_WITH_IMM,
                    send_flags=ib.SendFlags.SIGNALED,
                    remote_addr=remote_addr + offset,
                    rkey=remote_rkey,
                    imm_data=index,
                )
            )
```

### EFA

EFA is very similar to ibverbs, but it uses connectionless SRD queue pairs
instead of establishing a persistent RC connection:

```python
import efa
import efa.cuda as efa_cuda

...

device = efa.get_efa_device_list()[0]

with device.open() as ctx, ctx.alloc_pd() as pd, ctx.create_cq(16) as cq:
    qp = pd.create_qp(
        efa.QPInitAttr(send_cq=cq, recv_cq=cq)
    ).prepare(qkey=0x1234)

    local_info = efa.local_endpoint_info(qp, qkey=0x1234)

    # Exchange local_info.to_bytes() between ranks.
    ...
    remote_info = efa.EndpointInfo.from_bytes(remote_bytes)

    # EFA SRD is connectionless; each send identifies its destination.
    with remote_info.peer(pd) as peer:
        ...

        with efa_cuda.register_tensor(pd, tensor, access) as mr:
            if rank == 1:
                target = (mr.addr, mr.rkey)
                qp.post_recv(efa.RecvWR(wr_id=1, sg_list=[]))

            # Exchange rank 1's target address and rkey.
            ...

            if rank == 0:
                torch.cuda.current_stream().synchronize()

                qp.post_send(
                    efa.SendWR(
                        wr_id=2,
                        sg_list=[mr.sge()],
                        opcode=efa.WROpcode.RDMA_WRITE_WITH_IMM,
                        send_flags=efa.SendFlags.SIGNALED,
                        remote_addr=target_addr,
                        rkey=target_rkey,
                        imm_data=0xC0DE,
                        dest=peer,
                    )
                )
                wait(cq)

            else:
                notification = wait(cq)
                assert notification.imm_data == 0xC0DE

                efa_cuda.flush_gpudirect_writes()
                ...
```

### NVMe over Fabrics

The NVMe-oF API is the simplest of the three. It uses ibverbs under the hood with
a protocol for reading from and writing to the storage device:

```python
import nvmeof

...

with nvmeof.Controller.connect(
    TARGET,
    SUBSYSTEM_NQN,
    source=SOURCE,
) as controller:
    namespace = controller.namespace(NSID)
    tensor = torch.empty(
        namespace.lba_size, dtype=torch.uint8, device=gpu
    )

    with controller.register_gpu(tensor) as mr:
        with torch.cuda.device(gpu):
            namespace.read(mr, slba=SLBA, blocks=1)

    print(
        f"read LBA {SLBA} ({namespace.lba_size} bytes):",
        tensor[:16].cpu(),
    )
```

## Next Steps

### A PyTorch transfer engine

Now that we have flexible bindings for these transports, we could build a pure
Python, hackable, topology-aware transfer engine on top of them. If there is
interest, we would like to explore this further.

We would also like to experiment with integrating these APIs directly into
`torchstore` as optional transports, leveraging its existing weight-management
and coordination layers.

### Other backends

It should be straightforward to add backends such as libfabric, which do not
currently have Python bindings.

UCX has [`ucxx` on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ucxx-cu12/), but it is unclear
how widely it has been adopted, and we have not yet investigated all the backends
it supports out of the box. It is also an abstraction, so it does not provide
full access to each backend API.

### GPU-initiated operations

`rdma4py` currently supports only CPU-initiated operations. We should be able to
add helper code that triggers transfers from custom kernels. This could make it
possible to write extremely lightweight custom communication kernels entirely in
Python, without depending on existing backends such as NCCL GIN.
